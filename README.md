# StikyNotez
My second Swift 5 iOS App. Conveniently create notecards and sticky notes and manage your notes and reminders all in one view! Comes with a really nice user interface

iOS version: 13.2 and up (I think. I haven't really tested outdated versions)

## Description
I need to sort out my life right now. I have so many goals for 2020, things I have to memorize, reminders for the week... If only I could pin them on a single display and carry it around wherever I go and be able to access them conveniently.
Introducing... StikyNotez!!!

## Features
- Really Nice User Interface
Massive improvements in the UI from my first Swift app, GoalsDaily. The load screen and background look smooth, the generated text boxes look like actual sticky notes and notecards...

- Notecards and Sticky Notes
* Create them using left and right bottom buttons. The square logo creates sticky notes, the rectangle logo creates notecards!
* You can type text into them with however many lines you want!
* If you touch within one of the cards and drag them around, they will move!
* It stays within the screen boundaries without leaving it!

- Drag and Drop Trash Button
* Card becomes slightly transparent when you drag and hover it over the trash button and disappears by fading out when you release.

- Delete All
* You can delete all the cards at once by pressing the delete all button, which navigates you to a confirmation page before executing.

## Comments
This project took me a little less than 2 days of almost non-stop coding to complete! I had to get a lot of help and learn new things along the way, such as implementing the drag and drop feature for deleting the cards.
Some features I just could not find out how to implement include:
* preventing the notes resetting their positions to the center after interacting with the buttons.
* bringing selected notes, originally in the back relative to others, to the front without the problem above from happening.
